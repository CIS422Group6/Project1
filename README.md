# Project1

Use the file TheAddressBook.jar for running the program.

If you would like to compile the source code yourself, run "./compile" to put the .class files into a bin/ directory. If compile won't run, first try "chmod 755 compile". Failing that open it up with a text editor and run the commands yourself.
