# Project1

Run "./compile" to put the .class files into a bin/ directory. If compile won't run, first try "chmod 755 compile". Failing that open it up with a text editor and run the commands yourself.

There is also a (buggy) Makefile included. It seems that Ant is a beter alternative as Makefiles generally do not work well with Java.
